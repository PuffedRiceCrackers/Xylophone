<h1>Xylophone</h1>

Simple ios app that works as a virtual xylophone. 
Material provided from [AppBrewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/), and all my appreciation goes to the amazing instructor Angela Yu.

## I Learned

I learned some basic swift grammar and XCode interface, but most importantly, how to navigate the internet to find solution that an instructore didn't directly teach.

• Apple documentation is not kind but concise.<br />
• Linking View and the code<br />
• Manipulating View with Code<br />
• Swift Grammar such as functions, variable scope<br />
• Basic debugging

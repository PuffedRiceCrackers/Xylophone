<h1>Xylophone</h1>

Simple ios app that works as a virtual xylophone. 
Material provided from [AppBrewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/), and all my appreciation goes to the amazing instructor Angela Yu.

## I Learned

I learned some basic swift grammar and XCode interface, but most importantly, how to navigate the internet to find solution that an instructore didn't directly teach.

* Apple documentation is concise but not really kind<br />
* Linking the View and code<br />
* Manipulating the View with code<br />
* Swift Grammar such as functions and variable scope<br />
* Basic debugging
